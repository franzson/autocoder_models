This repository contains a number of pre-trained models for quick testing of the [autocoder external](https://).

#row 
A male and a female voice singing row, row, row your boat. 
As the input is monophonic, motion in the latent space translates into stepwise motion.
The input data is taken from [VocalSet](https://zenodo.org/record/1203819).
