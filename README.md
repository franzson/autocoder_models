# models

This repository contains a number of pre-trained models for quick testing of the [autocoder external](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder_external).

To train your own models, please see the [autocoder_training](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder_training) repository.

# [/row](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder_models/tree/main/row)

A male and a female voice singing *row, row, row your boat.*
As the input is monophonic, motion in the latent space translates into stepwise motion, producing a slow moving vocal texture.

A zip of the minimum needed files is [here]().

Recommended resynthesis parameters:<br>
    <pre>Brightness: .5
    Whitening: 0.8</pre>

The input data is taken from [VocalSet](https://zenodo.org/record/1203819).

# [/cymbal](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder_models/tree/main/cymbal)

A fragment from the Cartography of Time –– for solo cymbal and live electronics –– performed by Matthias Engler.

A zip of the minimum needed files is [here]().

Recommended resynthesis parameters:<br>
    <pre>Brightness: .5
    Smoothing: 0 - .5
    Whitening: 0.9</pre>
