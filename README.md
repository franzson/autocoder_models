# models

This repository contains a number of pre-trained models for quick testing of the [autocoder external](https://).

# [/row]()

A male and a female voice singing *row, row, row your boat.*
As the input is monophonic, motion in the latent space translates into stepwise motion, producing a slow moving vocal texture.

The input data is taken from [VocalSet](https://zenodo.org/record/1203819).

# [/cymbal/()

The input data is a fragment from the Cartography of Time –– for solo cymbal and live electronics, performed by Matthias Engler.
